INTRODUCTION                                    *testerical*

This plugin provides useful functionality for running Ruby tests, including
Ruby on Rails projects.

To see the results of your test when not using quickfix, make sure you have a
separate console tab, screen window, or whatever tailing your log file, which
by default is `/tmp/vim.log`, you can change this by setting the
g:testerical_log_file variable.

If you use Spork put `let g:testerical_in_spork = 1` in your configuration
file.

MAPS                               *testerical-mappings*

The following maps all correspond to normal mode commands.

*<leader>rt* |testerical-run-test-method|
*<leader>rT* |testerical-run-test-file|
*<leader>rl* |testerical-run-last|

                                                *testerical-run-test-method*
<leader>rt              Run the single test method your cursor is
                        currently inside/you are editing.

                        Can be remapped with `map mapping <Plug>TestericalRun`

                                                *testerical-run-test-file*
<leader>rT              Run the entire test file your cursor is currently
                        inside/you are editing. 

                        Can be remapped with `map mapping <Plug>TestericalFileRun`


                                                *testerical-run-last*
<leader>rl              Run the last test you ran, no matter what, or where
                        you are.

                        Can be remapped with `map mapping <Plug>TestericalRunLast`

                        I.e. if you last ran a single test (<leader>rt),
                        watched it fail, and wrote the implementation you
                        can call <leader>rl from your implementation. Same
                        goes if you last tested the entire file (<leader>rT).

TODO                                            *testerical-todo*

Not load the Rails environment everytime. :S
