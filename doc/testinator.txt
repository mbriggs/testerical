INTRODUCTION                                    *testinator*

This plugin provides useful functionality for running Ruby tests, including Ruby on Rails projects.

MAPS                               *testinator-mappings*

The following maps all correspond to normal mode commands.

*<leader>rt* |testinator-run-test-method|
*<leader>rT* |testinator-run-test-file|
*<leader>rl* |testinator-run-last|

                                                *testinator-run-test-method*
<leader>rt              Run the single test method your cursor is
                        currently inside/you are editing.

                                                *testinator-run-test-file*
<leader>rT              Run the entire test file your cursor is currently
                        inside/you are editing. 

                                                *testinator-run-last*
<leader>rl              Run the last test you ran, no matter what, or where you are.

                        I.e. if you last ran a single test (<leader>rt), watched it fail, and wrote the
                        implementation you can call <leader>rl from your implementation. Same goes if
                        you last tested the entire file (<leader>rT).

TODO                                            *testinator-todo*

Not load the Rails environment everytime.
